**A musical discord bot**

## How all it works?

I am using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) to talk to Discord API. Currently I am using a hack to run it on Github action as a CI/CD job which gets triggered by a cron scheduler every 30 mins and to avoid parllel jobs running, I have set job timeout to 30 mins. Looks [here](https://github.com/PranjalAgni/Musicord/blob/master/.github/workflows/run-discord-bot.yml) for better understanding
